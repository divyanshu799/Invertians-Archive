	<h1>Responsive HTML Gallery</h1>
	<p>This is a responsive image gallery I made a long time ago. It's come in quite handy over the years, and I thought others might find it useful as well. It features five images, but, of course, more can be added as necessary. This is designed primarily as a portfolio, with images acting as links to other resources, but it can also be used with a lightbox effect (not included in this code).

	<figure> <!--This is where the image is inserted.-->
    <a href="#" target="new"><img src="images/cascade.jpg" alt="Image 1" /></a>
    <figcaption><!--This is where the caption (if any) is inserted.-->Image 1</figcaption></figure>
